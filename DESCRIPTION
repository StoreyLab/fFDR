Title: Functional FDR for multiple hypothesis testing

Description: The functional FDR (fFDR) methodology utilizes an informative variable
    as well as p-value for multiple hypothesis testing. It models the likelihood of
    a true null hypothesis as a function of the informative variable (referred to as
    the "functional proportion""), and models the power of a statistical test also as a
    function of the informative variable. When neither the functional proportion nor
    the statistical test depends on the informtaive variable, the fFDR methodology
    reduces to the traditional q-value based FDR methodology.
